## 2026-09-02 22:16 — Initial request: dive-logging web app

> Create a nextjs web app to log dives. Follow the idea-146 repo and copy the agents guidelines from there. Use pumpking repo/mcp to provision a new dev-dives project and add kilo@aleksandr.vin as a user there, use authentik and postgres as in idea-146. Use dives.aleksandr.vin hostname, and use the underwater light rays effect that you built for 2prutsers.com (see repo around). Also add email integration with proton: I want every logged dive to be sent to user's email as a backup, so user owns the data.

Run via `/deep-interview`. Six rounds of Socratic questioning (topology: Dive Logging App, Infra & Auth Provisioning, Email Backup Integration, Underwater Visual Theme) brought ambiguity from 100% to ≈15%, below the 20% threshold. Spec crystallized at `.omc/specs/deep-interview-dive-logbook.md`.

Key decisions from the interview: multi-user from day one (each user's own private dives); dive computer profile is manual fields now, optional depth-profile import in v1, live device (Suunto) integration explicitly deferred; no photo/video storage in v1; dive sites are a structured, reusable per-user entity (not free text); backup email fires on create **and** edit **and** delete, with both a human-readable body and a structured JSON/CSV attachment; underwater theme is scoped to the light-rays overlay only, no broader palette rework.

## 2026-09-02 — Plan consensus (omc-plan --consensus --direct)

Planner → Architect → Critic loop, 4 revision rounds. Landed on extending idea-146's existing `notification_queue` outbox with a new `dive_backup` type (Option C) rather than a synchronous send or a brand-new parallel outbox table — full rationale in `.omc/plans/dives-dive-logbook-plan.md`'s ADR section. The review caught and fixed several real defects before any code was written: wrong mailer module reference, a transaction API that didn't exist yet, an idempotency-key design that would have silently dropped edits after the first, understated surgery on the notification worker's per-recipient batching, a nonexistent pumpking MCP tool reference, and a hardcoded `"BOMwatch"` sender that would have leaked into backup emails. Critic-approved as v5.

Two open questions resolved before build start: backup emails send **from** `zulu@aleksandr.vin` (reusing idea-146's SMTP identity) **to** each user's own Authentik login email (no per-user override in v1).

## 2026-09-02/03 — Team build (`/team`)

Executed via 7 staged tasks (scaffold → auth port → migrations/notification-type finalization → notification-queue worker surgery → CRUD actions → UI screens → this hygiene pass), each independently verified against the idea-146 source before committing. See `.omc/plans/dives-dive-logbook-plan.md` for the full acceptance criteria this build satisfies, and `docs/development.md` for the resulting architecture notes (final `notification_type` list, dive tables' per-user ownership rules, dive-backup payload contract, dive logbook screens).

Infra: pumpking project `dev-dives` (Authentik + Postgres, `dives.aleksandr.vin`) and user access for `kilo@aleksandr.vin` are committed locally in the `pumpking` repo, not yet pushed — pending review before the reconciler provisions the live cluster resources. `mcp__pumpking__add-user` hit a schema-drift bug (expects a `groups:` list, actual `users.yaml` uses a per-user `apps:` list) and was hand-applied instead; worth fixing upstream.

GitHub issue tracking (AGENTS.md's workflow) was explicitly skipped for this session — no remote is configured yet.

## 2026-09-04 09:38 — Activity calendar year-range selector

> Add a selector to the calendar view to choose how many years to show (All,1,2,...)

Added `getEarliestDiveDate` to `lib/dives.ts` and widened `/dashboard`'s activity fetch to span from the user's first dive (instead of a fixed 53-week window). `components/dive-activity-calendar.tsx` became a client component with a shadcn `Select` (year options 1..N, N = years of history capped at 10, plus "All") that reslices the already-fetched history client-side — no extra round trip per selection. "All" computes its own week count from the true earliest dive date rather than rounding to a whole year. No GitHub issue was created for this small addition; not asked about one before starting.
