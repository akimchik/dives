// Shared bidirectional maps between this app's dive-condition/equipment vocabulary and PADI's own
// enum codes (e.g. app "Wetsuit 7mm" <-> PADI "FullSuit_7mm", app "Mild" <-> PADI "SomeCurrent").
// Both `lib/padi/create.ts` (app -> PADI, on create/update) and `lib/padi/field-map.ts` (PADI ->
// app, on import) read from the same source maps so the two directions can't drift apart. See
// issue #20: an unrecognized code on either side falls through as-is rather than being dropped, so
// callers should always fall back to the raw value on a missed lookup (`map[value] ?? value`).

// Throws on a duplicate value rather than silently dropping an entry -- a non-injective source map
// would make the reverse lookup lossy, which defeats the whole point of deriving it instead of
// hand-writing it.
